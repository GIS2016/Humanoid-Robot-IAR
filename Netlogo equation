Performance = perf
Growth = g(x)
Rate of Change = r(x)
Price = p
Population = pop
Market Value = v

Equations: 
1.	Robot performance = perf(initial) * g(perf) * r(perf)
2.	Robot price = p(initial) * g(p) * r(p)
3.	Performance-price ratio [P/P] = perf/p
4.	Robot population = pop(initial) * g(P/P) * r(P/P)
5.	Robot market value = v(initial) * g(v) * r(v) / stock price * number of stock 
*5 switches = 5 variables
