Humanoid robot has been undergoing a continuous advancement by researchers from around the world for decades. There is an obvious trend that more countries especially Japan, Iran and the US are engaging in this field of study after the introduction of Star Wars in 1977 presenting R2-D2 and C-3PO two humanoid robots to the worldwide audience. Provided with a well-defined legal system which has stated a set of solid rules to protect human’s safety and safeguard people’s freedom, humanoid robots are welcome by the general public as a means to improve their social life. An age-friendly environment is supported for instance by easing the sense of loneliness among the elderlies through their interaction with the humanoid robots.
Alongside with the promising development of the six key technologies (i.e. cloud computing, big data analytics, machine learning, sensors application, natural language processing and battery development) embedded in humanoid robots, a positive growth in the humanoid robot industry is strongly expected. And the more popular usage and mature appliance of these technologies are as time goes by, the more critical progress is realised in humanoid robotic development. On the other hand, industries such as the healthcare, childcare and customer service ones are expanding constantly and have posed a larger demand on employing humanoid robots to serve their target customers with an aim to enhance users’ experience.
An ultimate condition of reduced cost and perfected performance occurs suggested by the powerful Moore’s Law when both the technologies has been speeded up and industrial demand has been magnified. The humanoid robot industry is therefore equipped with a very favourable context to grow exponentially in global marketplace.
