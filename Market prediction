The market value of humanoid robot is determined by various factors that are: technology, robot capability, robot price, market adoption and robot population. Because all of these factors will hold effects on others, it is essential to understand their relationships. In our model, advancement or regression in technology related to humanoid robots may impact humanoid robots’ performance and price. Whether the performance will improve or decline, and whether the price will increase or decrease, will consequently affect the market adoption. The market adoption across industries then determines humanoid robots’ population which gives direct indication to humanoid robots’ valuation.
 
Our analysis report shows that key technologies incorporated by humanoid robots are generally experiencing lower costs and having higher performance. This not only reduces the production cost and gives humanoid robots a lower price, humanoid robots can also provide greater capabilities and more functions associated with technological advancement. In view of humanoid robots’ ability to provide greater capabilities across industries together with the higher performance-price ratio, wide adoption across industries is expected. As a result, humanoid robot’s population and market value are going to grow exponentially.
