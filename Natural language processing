Definition of Natural Language Processing
Natural language procesing, or NLP for short, is used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how human’s speak. To understand human language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how they’re linked together to create meaning.
NLP and humanoid robots
Imaging that humanoid robots can understand human language, then we may talk with them, play with them, even falling love with them.  Speaking to a robot, it will let people control their homes, book movies, search the internet, ask follow-up questions about an Italian restaurant and sort through dog pictures using voice commands. NLP has already been used in smartphones. Google has Assistant, Apple has Siri, Amazon.com has Alexa and Facebook has M.
Applications of NLP on humanoid robots
An integrated humanoid robot system that is able to perform tasks in human environments responding to spoken language commands was created by Ee Sian Neo, Takeshi Sakaguchi and Kazuhito Yokoi. This system is able to understand natural language instructions and act accordingly on humanoid robot HBP-2.
 
The system on humanoid robot HBP-2
Smartphone combines features of a personal computer operating system which is similar to the operating system of humanoid robots. At this point, applications of NLP on Smartphone may be associated with applications of NLP on humanoid robots.
Google Assistant, a helpful voice-driven AI, is designed to be conversational and help you get things done.  For example, you could ask Google Assistant “Who designed this?” while standing in front of a famous sculpture with your phone, and the bot is able to mix location data and image recognition to identify exactly what you’re looking at and provide the answer in seconds. There are some other applications which are similar to Google Assitant such as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Facebook M, Microsoft Cortana.
