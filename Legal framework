Legal Issues arose from Pepper Robot Incident 

  

Principles of robotics
In 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) jointly published a set of five ethical "principles for designers, builders and users of robots". 
	LEGAL
1	Robots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security.
2	Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots should be designed; operated as far as is practicable to comply with existing laws & fundamental rights & freedoms, including privacy.
3	Robots are products. They should be designed using processes which assure their safety and security.
4	Robots are manufactured artefacts. They should not be designed in a deceptive way to exploit vulnerable users; instead their machine nature should be transparent.
5	The person with legal responsibility for a robot should be attributed.
